        The album includes material from the Beatle\' days as the Quarrymen, through the Decca audition to sessions for the album Beatles for Sale.
        It is of historical interest as the only official release of performances with Best and Sutcliffe in the band - Sutcliffe,
        the band\'s original bass player during 1960, and sporadically during the group\'s second Hamburg season,appears on the disc-one tracks \"Hallelujah,
        I Love Her So\", \"You\'ll Be Mine\" and \"Cayenne\"; while Best, who was the official drummer from just prior to the group\'s first departure for Hamburg in August 1960 until 15 August 1962 when he was replaced by Ringo Starr,
        is on Disc One, tracks 10–12, 15–19 and 21–22.\n
        Disc One, tracks 10–12 ,were recorded at a session in Hamburg where the Beatles served as the back-up band to the English rock and roll musician Tony Sheridan. Some songs from this session were released on the 1962 album My Bonnie,
        credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers. The song \"My Bonnie\" would be their introductory single in England, featuring Sheridan on lead vocal and guitar.\n Tracks 21–22 are the only surviving recordings of the Beatles\' first EMI session.
        Track 22 is the original recording of \"Love Me Do\", which would be re-recorded by the group four months later for their first single. Track 24 features EMI session drummer Andy White, in place of Ringo.
